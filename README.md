    You can play song you have added to the playlist.
    You are also able to create your own playlists and adding as many songs as you want.

4-) List of any additional requirements that were implemented.
    - Ability to rename and delete a playlist.  The user should be able to right‐click a playlist and select “Rename” from 
      the context menu.  Then a dialog box should display which allows the user to rename the playlist.
    - Control Template to alter the look and behavior of the Play and Stop buttons. 
    - Allow the user to enter a search string. As the string is being entered, the song list should be populated with any song
